Over the couple of years of diving deep into the world of computers and electronics, I've grown a sincere appreciation and preference for UNIX/Linux systems. Though I would not consider myself a skillful user by any means, I feel most comfortable in a UNIX/Linux environment when doing any kind of work with my computer. My personal UNIX weapon of choice, the MacBook Pro, has proven to be an invaluable tool for me through high school and into college; I've done so much work on it and it has slowly "molded" into a setup just to my liking.

I decided to take a break from school halfway into the Spring semester of 2020 after I realized that the learning experience, the reason I was at college in the first place, had gone to complete shit with COVID-19 and online classes. I also decided to get my mandatory military service requirement in the Korean army out of the way, since there was no better time to do it than now.
